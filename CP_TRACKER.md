## CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

| CP ID | Item | Lead Time | Risk | Mitigation |

## ISSUANCE RESOLUTION INTEGRATION

*The Issuance Resolution (January 22, 2026) materially strengthens the deal. Here is what it adds:*

### CPs Cleared by Issuance Resolution
- Corporate authorization of issuance ✅
- Validity of notes (500 × $10M, fully paid, non-assessable) ✅
- Transfer agent authority (STC authorized to issue + maintain ledger) ✅
- Outstanding amount confirmation ($5B) ✅
- Book-entry form confirmation ✅
- Cost basis anchored ($3B = $6M per note) ✅

### CPs Created by Issuance Resolution
| CP ID | New Item | Why |
|:------|:---------|:----|
| CP-21 | Holder-specific STC position statement | Resolution confirms issuer-level; lender needs holder-level |
| CP-22 | Negative lien / no prior pledge confirmation | Resolution silent on liens; officer cert confirms unencumbered |
| CP-23 | Evidence of $3B cost basis funding | Resolution anchors cost basis; lender wants subscription close evidence |

### Standard Sentence (use everywhere consistently)

> "The Notes were duly authorized by board resolution dated January 22, 2026, issued in book-entry form, and recorded by Securities Transfer Corporation as transfer agent. Total outstanding: $5,000,000,000 (500 notes × $10,000,000). Cost basis: $3,000,000,000. Fully paid and non-assessable."
