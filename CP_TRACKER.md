# CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TRACKER
## OPTKAS1 LLC — Secured Credit Facility

**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Maintained by:** jimmy@optkas.com  
**Purpose:** Operational CP tracking with evidence artifact mapping, blocking flags, and data room integration

---

## HOW TO USE THIS TRACKER

This is the **operational** version of the CP Checklist. Every CP has:

- **CP ID** — Unique sequential identifier (CP-01 through CP-62)
- **Phase** — When the CP is required (1–5)
- **Condition** — What the CP requires
- **Status** — Current readiness state
- **Owner** — Who is responsible for delivery
- **Evidence Artifact** — Exact data room folder + file that satisfies the CP
- **Date Available** — When the artifact is/will be available
- **Notes** — Lender-specific comments, customization notes
- **Blocking** — Whether this CP blocks closing if unsatisfied

**Status Key:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|:-------|:--------|
| ✅ Ready | Document exists, verified, deliverable immediately |
| 📋 Staged | Template/draft exists, requires customization or execution |
| ⏳ At Closing | Standard closing deliverable, produced upon engagement |
| 🔲 Lender-Dependent | Requires lender input before borrower can act |
| ❌ Gap | Missing — requires action |

**Blocking Key:**
| Flag | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| 🔴 Yes | Closing cannot proceed without this CP |
| 🟡 Conditional | Blocking only if lender requires it |
| 🟢 No | Not blocking; informational or post-closing |

---
