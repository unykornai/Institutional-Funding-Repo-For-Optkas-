**Status Key:**
- ✅ **Ready** — Document exists, verified, deliverable immediately
- 📋 **Staged** — Template/draft exists, requires customization or execution
- ⏳ **At Closing** — Standard closing deliverable, produced upon lender engagement
- 🔲 **Lender-Dependent** — Requires lender input, instruction, or coordination
