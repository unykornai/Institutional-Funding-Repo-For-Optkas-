## 2. COLLATERAL ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Primary Collateral — TC Advantage 5% Secured Medium Term Notes

| Parameter | Value | Source Verified |
|:----------|:------|:----------------|
| **Issuer** | TC Advantage Traders, Ltd. (Bahamas, Reg# 205197B) | PPM (May 29, 2020) |
| **Program Size** | $5,000,000,000 (500 notes × $10,000,000) | PPM page 2 / STC Security List |
| **Series B (144A) Outstanding** | $500,000,000 | STC Security List (Jan 23, 2026) |
| **Reg S Authorized** | $4,000,000,000 | STC Security List |
| **CUSIP (144A)** | 87225HAB4 | PPM / STC |
| **CUSIP (Reg S)** | P9000TAA8 | PPM / STC |
| **ISIN (144A)** | US87225HAB42 | PPM / STC |
| **Cost Basis** | $3,000,000,000 ($6M per note) | Subscription Agreement |
| **Coupon** | 5.00% per annum (paid before Feb 15) | PPM page 14 |
| **Maturity** | May 31, 2030 (4+ years remaining) | PPM page 14 |
| **Transfer Agent / Escrow / Paying Agent** | Securities Transfer Corporation, Plano TX | PPM page 2 |
| **Escrow Bank** | EagleBank, 7815 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814 | PPM page 22 |
| **Settlement** | DTC/DWAC FAST system | Subscription Agreement |
| **Offering Exemption** | Rule 144A (QIB/QP only) / Regulation S | PPM page 2 |
| **Holder Position** | 1 active holder (144A series) | STC Security List |
| **Physical Delivery** | FedEx tracked, received January 22, 2026 | Borrower attestation |

**Analyst Note:** The use of Securities Transfer Corporation as transfer agent and DTC/DWAC FAST as settlement infrastructure provides standard institutional-grade custody and clearing. STC is a recognized US transfer agent. Settlement mechanics are conventional.

### 2.2 Insurance Coverage

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|:----------|:------|:-------|
| **Broker** | C.J. Coleman & Company Limited | Lloyd's Confirmation (March 6, 2024) |
| **FCA Registration** | No. 30820 | FCA Financial Services Register (verifiable) |
| **Lloyd's Accreditation** | No. COL/879 | Lloyd's Confirmation |
| **Sum Insured** | USD $625,000,000 | Lloyd's Confirmation |
| **Insured Party** | TC Advantage Traders Limited | Lloyd's Confirmation |
| **Signatory** | John Collier, Divisional Director, Financial Institutions | Lloyd's Confirmation |
| **Market** | Lloyd's of London and Company Markets | Lloyd's Confirmation |

**Analyst Note:** C.J. Coleman is FCA-regulated and verifiable via the FCA Financial Services Register. However, the $625M sum insured represents approximately 12.5% of $5B face value. The PPM states the notes are "fully secured by an insurance wrap along with underlying properties" — this language requires clarification. The insurance confirmation letter references a specific sum insured; the "underlying properties" component referenced in the PPM has not been independently identified in the materials reviewed. **We recommend requesting the full schedule of participating insurers and policy terms, which C.J. Coleman has confirmed willingness to provide.**

### 2.3 Legal Opinion — K. Knowles & Co. (January 13, 2026)

Counsel (Freeport, Grand Bahama) has issued opinions covering:

| Opinion | Status | Analyst Assessment |
|:--------|:-------|:-------------------|
| Issuer Standing (Bahamas IBC, good standing) | Confirmed | Acceptable — subject to Bahamas counsel being appropriate for Bahamas-organized entity |
| Note Validity (duly authorized, issued, delivered) | Confirmed | Acceptable |
| SPV Authority (OPTKAS1 LLC authorized to hold/pledge) | Confirmed | Acceptable |
| Perfected Security Interest (UCC Articles 8/9) | Confirmed (upon filings) | CP item — requires actual UCC-1 filing |
| Eligible Collateral | Confirmed | Acceptable |
| No Conflicts | Confirmed | Acceptable |

**Analyst Note:** The legal opinion is competent and addresses core structural questions. However, K. Knowles & Co. is Bahamas counsel — appropriate for Issuer matters, but we should obtain a supplemental opinion from US-qualified counsel on (a) Wyoming UCC perfection, (b) enforceability of the Security Agreement under Wyoming law, and (c) SPV bankruptcy remoteness. This is standard for cross-border structures and is not a deficiency in the borrower's documentation.

## 3. BORROWING BASE & ADVANCE RATIONALE

### 3.1 Coverage Calculation

| Component | Amount |
|:----------|:-------|
| **Program Face Value** | $5,000,000,000 |
| **Cost Basis** | $3,000,000,000 |
| **Insurance Coverage** | $625,000,000 |
| **Annual Coupon Income** | $250,000,000 (5% × $5B) |
| **Advance Rate (proposed)** | 40% LTV |
| **Maximum Facility** | $2,000,000,000 |
| **Collateral Coverage Ratio** | 250% (face) / 150% (cost basis) |

### 3.2 Advance Rate Commentary

The proposed 40% advance rate against face value is within the conservative range cited in the legal opinion (10%–30% for MTN credit facilities). At face value, this produces 250% overcollateralization. At cost basis ($3B), it produces 150% coverage — still above standard minimums.

**Recommended Initial Advance:** We recommend sizing at the lower end of the per-institution range ($75M) for an initial commitment, with option to upsize to $150M–$300M upon:
- Satisfactory completion of all CPs
- Successful first coupon payment verification
- 90-day performance period with no covenant breaches

This phased approach manages concentration risk while preserving the borrower relationship.

### 3.3 Interest Coverage

Annual coupon income of $250M at program level provides substantial interest coverage for any individual tranche. Even a $300M facility at 10% ($30M annual interest) would be covered 8.3× by coupon income alone.

## 4. RISK FACTORS

### 4.1 ELEVATED RISK FACTORS

| # | Risk | Severity | Mitigant |
|:--|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| 1 | **Issuer Jurisdiction** — TC Advantage Traders is a Bahamas IBC; limited regulatory oversight compared to US/EU domiciled issuers | Moderate | (a) Legal opinion on file; (b) Notes are US-settled via DTC/DWAC; (c) STC is US-domiciled transfer agent; (d) Require lender's counsel Bahamas enforceability memo |
| 2 | **Restricted Securities** — Rule 144A / Reg S; limited secondary market liquidity | Moderate | (a) DTC-eligible, so settlement infrastructure exists; (b) Standard for private placement MTNs; (c) Haircut already reflects illiquidity; (d) STC can execute book-entry transfers |
| 3 | **Newly Formed SPV** — OPTKAS1 LLC formed Dec 19, 2025; no operating history, no audited financials | Moderate | (a) SPVs are expected to be newly formed; (b) Purpose-built for this collateral; (c) Covenant package constrains SPV activities; (d) Financial statements required as CP |
| 4 | **Face vs. Cost Basis Discount** — $5B face acquired at $3B cost (40% discount); raises question of market value vs. par | Elevated | (a) Advance rate based on face provides additional cushion; (b) Insurance provides partial floor; (c) Independent valuation required as CP; (d) 5% coupon suggests par-like economics |
| 5 | **Insurance Gap** — $625M covers 12.5% of $5B face; "underlying properties" referenced in PPM unidentified | Elevated | (a) Full policy schedule to be reviewed; (b) Insurance is supplemental, not primary recovery path; (c) UCC lien on notes is the primary security; (d) 250% overcollateralization is the primary mitigant |
| 6 | **Single Manager / Key Person** — Jimmy is sole manager of OPTKAS1 LLC | Low-Moderate | (a) Standard for SPVs; (b) Signer Attestations show dual authorization protocol with infrastructure partner; (c) K. Knowles & Co. designated as independent third-party signatory; (d) Require key person clause |

### 4.2 STANDARD RISK FACTORS

| # | Risk | Assessment |
|:--|:-----|:-----------|
| 7 | **Single-Asset Concentration** — Entire collateral pool is one issuer's MTN program | Standard for asset-backed facilities; mitigated by DTC settlement and size |
| 8 | **Cross-Border Legal Complexity** — Bahamas issuer, Wyoming SPV, multiple jurisdictions | Manageable with dual-jurisdiction counsel opinions (already partially addressed) |
| 9 | **Coupon Payment Verification** — No historical coupon payment records in materials reviewed | Require evidence of prior coupon payments or confirmation from paying agent (STC) |
| 10 | **Issuer Financial Opacity** — No TC Advantage financial statements provided | Standard CP item; Bahamas IBCs have limited public disclosure requirements |

---

## 5. MITIGANTS — STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS

### 5.1 Documentation Quality

The borrower's documentation package is institutional grade. Specifically:

- **Loan Commitment Package:** Pre-answers standard lender requirements with source citations for every material claim. Each figure traceable to PPM, STC records, or legal opinion.
- **Collateral Summary Sheet:** Clean, consistent with Commitment Package. No internal contradictions detected between core documents.
- **Legal Opinion:** Addresses six core opinions required for secured lending. Standard qualifications applied.
- **Corporate Formation Documents:** Certificate of Formation, Operating Agreement, and Signer Attestations are professional and complete. Formation date, registered agent, and authority chains are consistent across documents.
- **Wave 1 Lender Packages:** Reviewed sample (Apollo Global — $300M). Clean institutional language, consistent figures, appropriate lender-specific positioning. No crypto or digital asset semantics.

**Notable:** The borrower has pre-built a complete data room index, borrowing base policy, covenant schedule, and verification instructions. This level of preparation exceeds what most borrowers present at initial outreach.

### 5.2 Verification Infrastructure

The collateral is independently verifiable through multiple channels:
1. **STC Position Statement** — Direct transfer agent confirmation
2. **DTC/DWAC** — Book-entry verification via standard FAST system
3. **CUSIP Database** — Identifiers confirmed: 87225HAB4 (144A), P9000TAA8 (Reg S)
4. **FCA Register** — C.J. Coleman verifiable via UK FCA
5. **Wyoming Secretary of State** — SPV formation verifiable at wyobiz.wyo.gov

This multi-channel verification capability significantly reduces counterparty documentation risk.

### 5.3 Settlement & Enforcement Path

| Step | Mechanism | Timeline |
|:-----|:----------|:---------|
| 1 | UCC foreclosure notice | Day 0 |
| 2 | Account Control Agreement enforcement (STC) | Day 1–5 |
| 3 | STC executes book-entry transfer via DTC/DWAC FAST | Day 5–7 |
| 4 | Standard market liquidation or private placement | Day 7–30 |
| 5 | Court remedies (if required) | Day 30–90 |

The enforcement path is conventional and does not depend on borrower cooperation post-default (assuming Control Agreement is properly executed with STC).

## 7. AREAS OF LESS THAN STRONG CONFIDENCE

The following items, while not deal-breaking, require additional diligence or represent areas where confidence is less than strong:

### 7.1 True Market Value of Collateral

The $5B face value and $3B cost basis create a $2B valuation gap. Without an independent appraisal or evidence of secondary market transactions, we cannot confirm whether market value is closer to face ($5B), cost ($3B), or some other figure. The advance rate of 40% against face ($2B) is at or below cost basis, which provides a structural floor — but an independent valuation would materially strengthen our comfort.

**Recommendation:** Require independent valuation as a CP-1 item.

### 7.2 Issuer Creditworthiness

No financial statements from TC Advantage Traders, Ltd. have been reviewed. As a Bahamas IBC, public disclosure requirements are minimal. The 5% coupon obligation ($250M/year on $5B face) is substantial — we would want evidence that the issuer can service this or that the "underlying properties" referenced in the PPM provide adequate backing.

**Recommendation:** Request issuer financials or, at minimum, a paying agent confirmation of historical coupon payments.

### 7.3 Insurance "Wrap" Characterization

The PPM describes the notes as "fully secured by an insurance wrap along with underlying properties." The Lloyd's confirmation letter references a $625M sum insured — which is not "full" coverage of the $5B program. The characterization requires clarification: is the $625M a specific tranche, a deductible layer, or the total coverage? What are the "underlying properties"?

**Recommendation:** Full policy review. Engage directly with C.J. Coleman.

## 8. FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **APPROVE — CONDITIONAL, SUBJECT TO STANDARD CPs**

**Sizing Recommendation:**

| Phase | Amount | Condition |
|:------|:-------|:----------|
| **Initial Commitment** | $75,000,000 | Upon satisfaction of all CPs (Section 6) |
| **First Upsize** | $150,000,000 | After 90-day performance period, coupon verification, clean covenant compliance |
| **Full Commitment** | $300,000,000 | After 180-day track record, independent valuation confirms adequate market value |

**Rationale for Approval:**

1. **Overcollateralization is real and verifiable.** The 250% coverage ratio at face value (150% at cost) exceeds standard thresholds. The collateral is held at a recognized US transfer agent with DTC/DWAC settlement capability.

2. **Documentation is institutional grade.** The borrower has produced one of the more complete pre-commitment packages this desk has reviewed. Core documents (Loan Commitment Package, Collateral Summary, Legal Opinion) are internally consistent with traceable source citations. No improvised or contradictory figures detected in the lender-facing materials.

3. **Verification infrastructure exists independently of borrower.** STC confirmation, DTC settlement, FCA-regulated insurance broker, and CUSIP identifiers allow independent verification without reliance on borrower representations.

4. **Enforcement path is conventional.** UCC foreclosure plus Account Control Agreement gives standard secured creditor remedies. DTC/DWAC settlement provides 5–7 day liquidation timeline under normal conditions.

5. **Risk factors are manageable with standard CPs.** Jurisdiction risk, insurance gap, and valuation uncertainty are all addressable through conditions precedent that the borrower appears prepared to satisfy.

**Rationale for Phased Sizing:**

The newly formed SPV, offshore issuer, restricted security status, and absence of independent valuation warrant conservative initial sizing. The $75M initial commitment allows us to build a performance track record before scaling exposure. This is not a reflection of documentation quality (which is strong) but rather standard prudence for a first transaction with a new counterparty in a cross-border structure.
