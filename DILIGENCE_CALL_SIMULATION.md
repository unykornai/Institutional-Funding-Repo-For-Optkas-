## BLOCK A: MANAGING DIRECTOR — DEAL STRUCTURE & CREDIT THESIS
*"Walk us through the deal."*

---

### Q-01: What is the collateral and how is it valued?

**Best Answer:**  
The collateral is 500 units of TC Advantage 5% Secured Medium Term Notes issued by TC Advantage Traders, Ltd. (Reg# 205197B, Freeport, Grand Bahama). Total face value $5 billion. Cost basis to OPTKAS1 LLC is $3 billion. The notes carry a 5% annual coupon with maturity May 31, 2030. They are held in book-entry form at Securities Transfer Corporation (STC), 2901 Dallas Parkway Suite 380, Plano, TX 75093.

**Data Room Reference:** `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/03.01 PPM.pdf`, `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/03.03 STC Security List.pdf`, `01_EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW/01.02 Collateral Summary Sheet.pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-03, CP-05, CP-07  
**Gap Flag:** 🟢 None — all documents on file

---

### Q-02: What is the proposed facility structure?

**Best Answer:**  
Asset-backed secured credit facility. 40% loan-to-value advance rate against the $5B face value collateral, yielding a maximum theoretical facility of $2 billion. Per-institution sizing $75 million to $300 million depending on lender appetite. Overcollateralization ratio at 40% LTV is 250%+. First-priority perfected security interest via UCC-1 filing in Wyoming plus Account Control Agreement at STC/EagleBank.

**Data Room Reference:** `01_EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW/01.01 Executive Summary.pdf`, `01_EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW/01.04 Borrowing Base Policy.pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-01, CP-11  
**Gap Flag:** 🟢 None

---

### Q-03: Who is the borrower? What is its operating history?

**Best Answer:**  
OPTKAS1 LLC is a Wyoming Series LLC formed December 19, 2025 (File# 2025-001184729). It is a special-purpose vehicle with no operating history — that is by design. The SPV was created as a bankruptcy-remote, single-purpose entity whose sole activity is holding the collateral notes and servicing the credit facility. Jimmy serves as Manager with full authority per the Operating Agreement.

**Data Room Reference:** `02_ENTITY_DOCUMENTS/02.01 Certificate of Formation.pdf`, `02_ENTITY_DOCUMENTS/02.02 Operating Agreement.pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-09, CP-10  
**Gap Flag:** 🟢 None — newly formed SPV is standard for structured finance

---

### Q-04: How does debt service work with no operating revenue?

**Best Answer:**  
The notes generate $250 million per year in coupon income (5% × $5B face). Interest expense on a $150M facility at SOFR + 500 bps (assuming ~10% all-in) would be approximately $15 million per year. Debt service coverage ratio from coupon income alone is approximately 16.7x. Additionally, the overcollateralization provides structural protection — the collateral value exceeds the loan by 250%+.

**Data Room Reference:** `01_EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW/01.04 Borrowing Base Policy.pdf`, `08_LENDER_PACKAGE/08.01 Loan Commitment Package.pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-02, CP-11  
**Gap Flag:** 🟢 None

---

### Q-05: What insurance covers the collateral?

**Best Answer:**  
The notes are insured through C.J. Coleman & Co Ltd (FCA #30820, Lloyd's broker, COL/879) with a sum insured of $625 million USD. The insurance confirmation letter is dated March 6, 2024, signed by John Collier. C.J. Coleman is registered with the UK Financial Conduct Authority — you can verify at the FCA Financial Services Register using reference number 30820. Full policy schedule and participating Lloyd's syndicates list available upon request (5–7 business day turnaround from broker).

**CP IDs:** CP-06, CP-30, CP-44  
**Gap Flag:** 🟡 CP-30 (full policy schedule) and CP-44 (lender-named certificate) require broker coordination — 5–7 BD turnaround

---

### Q-06: What is the issuer's credit profile?

**Best Answer:**  
TC Advantage Traders, Ltd. is a Bahamas-registered entity (Reg# 205197B). The notes were issued under a $5 billion program per the PPM dated May 29, 2020 (47 pages). The issuance was authorized by Chairman Larry Corona via Issuance Resolution dated January 22, 2026. The notes carry CUSIPs: 144A: 87225HAB4, Reg S: P9000TAA8. Our legal counsel K. Knowles & Co. has opined on the validity, proper authorization, and enforceability of the notes.

**CP IDs:** CP-04, CP-07, CP-08  
**Gap Flag:** 🟡 Lender may want independent valuation (CP-16) — borrower cooperates fully

---

### Q-07: What is your advance rate methodology?

**Best Answer:**  
40% LTV against face value. Conservative by design — most note-backed ABL facilities operate at 50–70% LTV. Our Borrowing Base Policy documents the haircut methodology: face value → apply 40% advance rate → maximum advance. The overcollateralization ratio at this LTV is 250%+, providing substantial cushion. The borrowing base certificate will be updated monthly as a post-closing covenant.

**Data Room Reference:** `01_EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW/01.04 Borrowing Base Policy.pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-11, CP-42, CP-52

## BLOCK B: OUTSIDE COUNSEL — LEGAL ENFORCEABILITY & SECURITY INTEREST
*"Can we enforce this? Is the lien perfectable?"*

---

### Q-08: What is the legal opinion on collateral validity?

**Best Answer:**  
K. Knowles & Co. (Suite D, Bain Building, Freeport, Grand Bahama) issued an 8-page legal opinion dated January 13, 2026. It contains 6 formal opinions covering: (1) valid issuance, (2) proper authorization, (3) binding obligation of issuer, (4) compliance with offering documents, (5) eligible collateral status, and (6) enforceability of security interest. The opinion covers both Bahamas and US law.

**Data Room Reference:** `05_LEGAL/05.01 Legal Opinion — K. Knowles & Co. (Jan 13, 2026).pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-04  
**Gap Flag:** 🟡 Lender may request supplemental US-qualified opinion (CP-31) — borrower cooperates

---

### Q-09: How is the security interest perfected?

**Best Answer:**  
Three-layer perfection: (1) UCC-1 Financing Statement filed in Wyoming (OPTKAS1 LLC's state of formation), (2) Account Control Agreement with STC as securities intermediary and EagleBank as escrow agent, and (3) Pledge Agreement granting lender first-priority security interest in the notes. Upon filing, lender will have a perfected, first-priority security interest under UCC Article 8 (securities) and Article 9 (secured transactions).

**Data Room Reference:** `05_LEGAL/05.06 UCC-1 Financing Statement.pdf`, `05_LEGAL/05.05 Account Control Agreement.pdf`, `05_LEGAL/05.04 Pledge Agreement.pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-36, CP-35, CP-34  
**Gap Flag:** 🟢 Templates ready; finalize during document negotiation

---

### Q-10: Is there any existing lien on the collateral?

**Best Answer:**  
No. The notes are unencumbered. A UCC search in Wyoming and all relevant jurisdictions will confirm no prior filings. Additionally, the STC Position Statement will confirm the notes are held free and clear in OPTKAS1 LLC's account. The borrower will provide a UCC pre-search at its own cost if the lender prefers to verify before engaging counsel.

**Data Room Reference:** `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/03.03 STC Security List.pdf`  
**CP IDs:** CP-15, CP-14  
**Gap Flag:** 🟢 Clean; UCC search will confirm

---

### Q-11: Is the SPV properly structured for bankruptcy remoteness?

Yes. OPTKAS1 LLC is a Wyoming Series LLC with: (1) single-purpose entity restrictions in the Operating Agreement, (2) no employees, no operating business, no trade creditors, (3) sole activity is holding collateral and servicing the facility, (4) separateness covenants requiring maintenance of SPV status, and (5) no rehypothecation covenant.

The UCC-1 is filed in Wyoming (borrower's state of formation). The Account Control Agreement will be governed by New York law. K. Knowles' opinion covers Bahamas law aspects of the underlying notes.

### Q-13: Can the notes be liquidated if we need to foreclose?

**Best Answer:**  
Yes. The notes are held in book-entry form at STC, which participates in the DTC FAST system. They can be settled via DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian). In a foreclosure scenario, the lender can direct STC to transfer the notes pursuant to the Control Agreement and Pledge Agreement. There is also a deep secondary market for investment-grade medium-term notes. The insurance coverage ($625M) provides an additional recovery path.

**Data Room Reference:** `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/DTC_DWAC_Eligibility.pdf`, `04_INSURANCE/04.01 Lloyd's Insurance Confirmation Letter.pdf`

### Q-14: Where are the notes held?

**Best Answer:**  
Securities Transfer Corporation (STC), 2901 Dallas Parkway Suite 380, Plano, Texas 75093. STC acts as transfer agent and registrar. The notes are held in book-entry form in OPTKAS1 LLC's account.

**Gap Flag:** 🟢 Verification instructions provided

---

### Q-15: How does the Account Control Agreement work?

**Best Answer:**  
Tri-party agreement between OPTKAS1 LLC (borrower), STC (securities intermediary), and the lender. The ACA gives the lender "control" over the securities account under UCC 8-106. In normal operations, the borrower receives coupon payments. Upon an event of default, the lender can issue instructions directly to STC without borrower consent — including directions to transfer, sell, or hold the notes. EagleBank (7815 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814) serves as escrow agent for cash proceeds.

### Q-18: What happens to coupon payments during the facility?

**Best Answer:**  
The 5% annual coupon ($250M/year on $5B face) is paid through STC as paying agent. During normal operations, coupon payments flow to the borrower's account per the Facility Agreement terms. The lender may require a lockbox or sweep arrangement as a covenant. Upon default, coupon payments are redirected to the lender per the Account Control Agreement.
