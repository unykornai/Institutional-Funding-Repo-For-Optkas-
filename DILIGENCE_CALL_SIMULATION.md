## BLOCK A: CREDIT MD — DEAL STRUCTURE & COLLATERAL

---

### Q-01: What exactly is the facility request and cap?

**Who asks:** Managing Director (Credit)

**Best answer:**  
Asset-backed secured credit facility. $75M–$300M per institution, $2B maximum aggregate capacity. 40% loan-to-value advance rate against $5B face value collateral ($3B cost basis). Overcollateralization ratio 250%+. First-priority perfected security interest via UCC-1 + Account Control Agreement at STC.

**Evidence:** `01_EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW/01.01 Executive Summary.pdf`  
**CP:** CP-01, CP-03  
**Gap:** 🟢 None — documents on file

---

### Q-02: Define the collateral — issuer, CUSIP, face vs basis, restrictions.

**Who asks:** Credit MD / Analyst

**Best answer:**  
500 units of TC Advantage 5% Secured Medium Term Notes. Issuer: TC Advantage Traders, Ltd. (Reg# 205197B, Freeport, Grand Bahama). CUSIP 144A: 87225HAB4, Reg S: P9000TAA8. Face value $5B ($10M × 500 notes). Cost basis $3B ($6M per note). 5% annual coupon, maturity May 31, 2030. Book-entry only, held at STC. 144A/Reg S restricted securities. Issuance authorized January 22, 2026 by board resolution; fully paid and non-assessable.

**Evidence:** `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/03.01 Private Placement Memorandum (May 29, 2020).pdf` + `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/03.07 Issuance Resolution (Jan 22, 2026).pdf`  
**CP:** CP-06  
**Gap:** 🟢 None — PPM (47 pages) + Issuance Resolution on file

---

### Q-03: Why is 40% advance appropriate, and how is 250%+ coverage computed?

**Who asks:** Credit Analyst

**Best answer:**  
40% LTV is conservative by design — most note-backed ABL facilities operate at 50–70% LTV. The advance rate is applied to face value ($5B × 40% = $2B max). Coverage ratio = face value ÷ maximum advance = 250%. Even against cost basis ($3B), coverage at full $2B advance is 150%. The Borrowing Base Policy documents the haircut methodology. Monthly BBC updates are a post-closing covenant.

**Evidence:** `01_EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW/01.04 Borrowing Base Policy.pdf` + `07_FINANCIAL/07.01 Borrowing Base Certificate (initial).pdf`  
**CP:** CP-11, CP-17  
**Gap:** 🟡 CP-18 (Valuation memo / Broker Opinion of Value) — **PRIMARY GATING ITEM**. Cost basis is anchored by Issuance Resolution. Recommend producing BOV to close this.

---

### Q-04: What are the top 5 risks and mitigants?

**Who asks:** Credit MD

**Best answer:**  
(1) **Collateral liquidity** — Mitigant: DTC/DWAC eligible, book-entry at STC, 144A/Reg S transferable. (2) **Issuer credit** — Mitigant: 250%+ overcollateralization; $625M insurance; coupon provides 16.7x DSCR. (3) **SPV newness** — Mitigant: Single-purpose bankruptcy-remote by design; no operating risk. (4) **Bahamas-domiciled issuer** — Mitigant: K. Knowles opinion covers both Bahamas + US law; lender perfects under Wyoming/NY UCC. (5) **Concentration** — Mitigant: Single-issuer concentration is standard for note-backed facilities; insurance diversifies recovery.

**Evidence:** `08_LENDER_PACKAGE/08.02 Credit Committee Positioning Brief.pdf`  
**CP:** CP-12  
**Gap:** 🟢 None

---

### Q-05: What is the default plan and enforcement path?

**Who asks:** Credit MD / Counsel

**Best answer:**  
Upon event of default: (1) Lender issues notice to STC under Control Agreement — no borrower cooperation needed. (2) STC transfers or holds notes per lender instruction (UCC 8-106 control). (3) Lender can direct sale via DTC/DWAC settlement. (4) Insurance claim filed with C.J. Coleman if applicable. (5) UCC foreclosure via Wyoming filing. Base case recovery: 90–100% (overcollateralized). Stress: 60–80%. Catastrophic: 30–45%.

**Evidence:** `05_LEGAL/05.03 Security Agreement.pdf` + `05_LEGAL/05.05 Account Control Agreement — STC.pdf`

**Who asks:** Operations / Custody team

**Best answer:**  
Securities Transfer Corporation (STC), 2901 Dallas Parkway Suite 380, Plano, Texas 75093. STC acts as transfer agent and registrar. 500 units of TC Advantage 5% Notes held in book-entry form in OPTKAS1 LLC's account. STC was authorized by the issuer's board resolution to issue notes and maintain the official ledger.

**Evidence:** `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/03.03 STC Security List by Issuer (Jan 23, 2026).pdf`  
**CP:** CP-07  
**Gap:** 🟡 CP-21 — Holder-specific STC position statement (3–5 BD upon request). Issuer-level list available immediately.

---

### Q-07: How does control work (control agreement / account control)?

**Who asks:** Operations / Counsel

**Best answer:**  
Tri-party Account Control Agreement between OPTKAS1 LLC (borrower), STC (securities intermediary), and lender. Gives lender "control" under UCC 8-106. Normal operations: borrower receives coupon payments. Default: lender issues instructions directly to STC without borrower consent — transfer, sell, or hold. EagleBank (7815 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814) serves as escrow agent for cash proceeds.

**Evidence:** `05_LEGAL/05.05 Account Control Agreement — STC.pdf`  
**CP:** CP-31  
**Gap:** 🟢 Template ready — requires STC coordination to execute

---

### Q-08: What is the timeline to confirm holder-specific position?

**Who asks:** Operations

**Best answer:**  
3–5 business days from request. Borrower contacts STC, requests Position Statement specifically addressed to lender confirming: (1) notes held in OPTKAS1 LLC's account, (2) current position (500 notes, $5B face), (3) no liens or encumbrances. Lender can also contact STC directly using verification instructions in Folder 09.

**Evidence:** `09_VERIFICATION/09.02 STC Contact Information & Verification Process.pdf`  
**CP:** CP-19, CP-21  
**Gap:** 🟢 Process documented; 3–5 BD turnaround

---

### Q-09: Can settlement occur without borrower cooperation after default?

**Who asks:** Operations / Counsel

**Best answer:**  
Yes. The Account Control Agreement gives the lender the right to issue instructions directly to STC without borrower consent after an event of default. STC is contractually obligated to follow lender's instructions. This is the entire purpose of "control" under UCC 8-106. No court order required for STC to comply.

**Evidence:** `05_LEGAL/05.05 Account Control Agreement — STC.pdf`  
**CP:** CP-31  
**Gap:** 🟢 Standard ACA mechanics

---

### Q-10: Any operational dependencies (DTC, DWAC, etc.)?

**Who asks:** Operations

**Best answer:**  
Notes are DTC/DWAC eligible. STC participates in the DTC FAST system, which implies book-entry eligibility. Settlement can occur via Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian. Formal DTC/DWAC eligibility letter available upon request (2–3 BD). CUSIPs registered: 87225HAB4 (144A), P9000TAA8 (Reg S).

**Evidence:** `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/DTC_DWAC_Eligibility.pdf` + `09_VERIFICATION/09.03 CUSIP / ISIN Cross-Reference.pdf`

K. Knowles & Co. (Suite D, Bain Building, Freeport, Grand Bahama) issued an 8-page opinion January 13, 2026 containing 6 formal opinions: (1) valid issuance, (2) proper authorization, (3) binding obligation of issuer, (4) compliance with offering documents, (5) eligible collateral status, (6) enforceability of security interest. Opinion covers both Bahamas and US law. Reliance language should be confirmed with lender's counsel — borrower will request K. Knowles to extend reliance if needed.

**Evidence:** `05_LEGAL/05.01 Legal Opinion — K. Knowles & Co. (Jan 13, 2026).pdf`  
**CP:** CP-09  
**Gap:** 🟡 CP-39 — Lender may request supplemental US-qualified opinion. Borrower cooperates fully.

---

### Q-12: What law governs the security agreement and where is collateral located legally?

**Who asks:** Counsel

**Best answer:**  
Facility Agreement, Security Agreement, and Pledge Agreement governed by New York law (standard for institutional credit facilities). UCC-1 filed in Wyoming (borrower's state of formation). Control Agreement governed by New York law. Notes held at STC in Texas. Collateral "located" for UCC purposes at debtor's jurisdiction (Wyoming). K. Knowles opinion covers Bahamas law aspects of underlying notes.

**Evidence:** `05_LEGAL/05.03 Security Agreement.pdf`

**Evidence:** `05_LEGAL/05.06 UCC-1 Financing Statement.pdf`  
**CP:** CP-33  
**Gap:** 🟢 Ready to file

---

### Q-14: Any restrictions on pledge/transfer of the notes?

**Who asks:** Counsel

**Best answer:**  
Notes are 144A/Reg S restricted securities. Transfer restrictions apply per the PPM and customary 144A/Reg S legends. However, pledge to an institutional lender as collateral for a credit facility is a standard permitted transfer under 144A. The Security Agreement and Pledge Agreement will address transfer mechanics. STC, as transfer agent, will acknowledge the pledge via the Control Agreement.

**Evidence:** `03_COLLATERAL_DOCUMENTATION/03.01 Private Placement Memorandum (May 29, 2020).pdf`  
**CP:** CP-06  
**Gap:** 🟢 Standard 144A pledge structure
