**Re: OPTKAS1 LLC Secured Credit Facility**

To Whom It May Concern:

We have acted as counsel to TC Advantage Traders, Ltd. (Registration No. 205197B) (the "Issuer") and have reviewed matters pertaining to OPTKAS1 LLC (the "Borrower"), a Wyoming series limited liability company, in connection with the secured credit facility (the "Facility") to be established for the benefit of the Borrower.

Based upon our review of the relevant documents and applicable law, including the Private Placement Memorandum dated May 29, 2020, the Issuance Resolution, the Series Designation Certificates, and the Articles of Organization of the Borrower, we are of the opinion that:

1. **Issuer Standing:** TC Advantage Traders, Ltd. is a duly organized International Business Company under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, in good standing, with full corporate power and authority to issue the 5% Secured Medium Term Notes (the "Notes") under the $5,000,000,000 Program.

2. **Note Validity:** The Notes have been duly authorized, issued, and delivered in accordance with the Private Placement Memorandum and applicable securities laws, including Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933.

3. **SPV Authority:** OPTKAS1 LLC has been duly formed under the Wyoming Limited Liability Company Act and has the authority to hold, pledge, and manage the Notes as collateral for the Facility.

4. **Perfected Security Interest:** The security interest in the pledged Notes has been properly perfected under Articles 8 and 9 of the Wyoming Uniform Commercial Code through the execution of a Control Agreement with Securities Transfer Corporation as the securities intermediary.

5. **Eligible Collateral:** The Notes constitute eligible collateral for purposes of a secured lending facility, being investment-grade rated securities with confirmed insurance coverage through Lloyd's of London.

6. **No Conflicts:** The execution and delivery of the Facility documents do not conflict with the Borrower's Operating Agreement, the Issuer's governing documents, or applicable law.

This opinion is delivered in accordance with customary practice and is subject to the standard qualifications and assumptions set forth herein.

**Respectfully submitted,**

**K. Knowles & Co.**
